When you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser's address bar and press enter, several steps occur behind the scenes:

1. **DNS Lookup**: Your browser checks its local DNS cache to see if it already knows the IP address associated with "www.google.com". If it doesn't, it sends a request to a DNS server to translate the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address.

2. **Establishing a TCP Connection**: Once the IP address is obtained, your browser initiates a TCP connection to the server at that IP address. For HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) websites like Google, this connection is typically made over port 443.

3. **TLS Handshake**: If the website supports HTTPS, your browser and the server engage in a TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake to establish a secure connection. During this process, they agree on encryption algorithms and exchange cryptographic keys.

4. **HTTP Request**: After the secure connection is established, your browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server, specifying the resource it wants to retrieve, in this case, the homepage of Google.

5. **Server Processing**: The server receives the request, processes it, and generates an appropriate response. In the case of Google's homepage, this response typically includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

6. **HTTP Response**: The server sends the response back to your browser over the established secure connection.

7. **Rendering**: Your browser receives the response and begins to render the webpage. It interprets the HTML code, applies CSS styles, and executes any JavaScript code to display the Google homepage as you see it.

8. **Display**: Finally, your browser displays the rendered webpage, allowing you to interact with Google's search engine and other features.

Throughout this process, there may be additional steps such as caching at various levels (browser cache, proxy servers, etc.) to optimize performance and reduce load on the server.
